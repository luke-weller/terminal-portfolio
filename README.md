### Technologies Used

This personal portfolio project is built using the following technologies:

- JavaScript: I chose JavaScript as my primary language for its versatility and popularity in web development.
- HTML and CSS: I am using HTML and CSS to build the front-end of my web application, allowing me to structure and style the content and layout of my website.
- Node.js: I am using Node.js to build the server-side of my web application, allowing me to run JavaScript on the server and interact with files and databases.
- Jest: I am using Jest as my automated testing framework to ensure that my code is working as expected and to catch bugs early in the development process.
- GitHub Actions: I am using GitHub Actions to set up a continuous integration and delivery pipeline, allowing me to automate the build, test, and deployment process for my application.

By using these technologies, I aim to create a fast, responsive, and secure personal portfolio website that showcases my development skills and serves as a platform for sharing my work and experiences with others. Throughout the development process, I will document my progress and share my code with the community to encourage collaboration and feedback.
